            <h2>Horacio Pagani</h2>
            <img src="c:\Users\praveen\Downloads\social.jpg" alt="Horacio" width="770" height="403">
            <p>A man, Horacio, inspired by an extremely lively curiosity. His measured speaking but, at the same time,
                 full of passion, tells about a man driven by emotions and simultaneously by a significant harshness. 
                 The futuristic museum-factory of San Cesario sul Panaro was designed, together with his team of designers, 
                 to go with memory through the way that brought him to create the most exclusive supercars’ tailor shop in 
                 the world. If it wasn’t set in Argentina and Italy, the story of Horacio Pagani could be the summary of 
                 the American dream, the ambitious engineering adventure of a contemporary motoring myth.</p>
